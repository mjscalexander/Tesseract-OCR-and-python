# Tesseract-OCR-and-python
Simple python OCR build for Windows Users

In order for this to work you have to install the tesseract OCR engine. I installed it from the following link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/tesseract-ocr-alt/files/

If you find a better or more efficienct way to build this script, please share. Thank you.

props to Dr. Adrian Rosebuck for paving the way.
